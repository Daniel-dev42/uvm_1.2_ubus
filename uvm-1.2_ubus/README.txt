UBus Example from UVM-1.2 library

From UVM User Guide PDF - Chapter 8.UBus Specification
	The motivation for the UBus specification is to provide an example of a simple bus standard for demonstration purposes and to illustrate the methodology required for a bus-based verification component. As such, the UBus specification is designed to demonstrate all of the important features of a typical modern bus standard while keeping complexity to a minimum.
